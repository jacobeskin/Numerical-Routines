# Numerical-Routines
Programs and modules of numerical methods 

Modules and source code files of numerical solutions to different problems. I will try and have a detailed description of the routines as comments inside the files, but will add short descritions here as well.

tridiag.f90: Three routines for solving second order differential equation that reduces to solving tridiagonal matrix equation; SOR, Thomas algorithm and Numerov method.

SE_H_bisectio.f90: Bisection method solution for the Schr√∂dinger equation for Hydrogen atom.
